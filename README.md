### Howdy folks!

I'm Emily, a full-stack developer (leaning FE) based in Toronto.

**What I'm about:**
- Diving into new tools and frameworks - fast learner, will figure it out
- Scaling/test automation (it's not enough to just make it work, it should be fast too)
- Recently spent nearly 2 years at North One working across the stack (Python fraud detection models to mobile apps)

**When I'm not coding:**
- Traveling and plotting my next adventure
- Picking up new languages (currently Spanish)
- Perfecting my slackmoji game (consults available free of charge)

**Tech I work with most:** TypeScript, React, Python, Node.js, and all the usual suspects

📫 eoudyk@gmail.com - always happy to chat about tech, travel, or that one weird bug you can't figure out.
